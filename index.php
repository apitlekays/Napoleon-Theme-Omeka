        <p class="introduction">Everyone has heard of Waterloo. Less well-known is that Napoleon had already been defeated in 1814, but escaped his exile on Elba in February 1815, swept across France gathering troops, and toppled the newly restored Bourbon monarchy in Paris without firing a shot. Only then was he defeated by Wellington in June 1815, finally surrendering in July. Dad by day, this website releases an object that sheds light on these dramatic events, along with weekly summaries sketching out the period as a whole.
